<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The TiO2 Pigment Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Sulfate Process</li><li>Chloride Process</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The TiO2 pigment market primarily features two production methods: the sulfate process and the chloride process. The sulfate process, which involves sulfuric acid, is older and typically results in lower purity and higher production costs. Conversely, the chloride process utilizes chlorine and produces higher purity TiO2 with better color quality and opacity, making it more favorable for premium applications. The choice between these methods influences production efficiency, cost structure, and the quality of the final pigment product.</p></p>
