<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Cartilage Repair/Regeneration Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Cell-Based</li><li>Non-Cell-Based</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The cartilage repair and regeneration market can be categorized into two main types: cell-based and non-cell-based therapies. Cell-based approaches involve using living cells, such as chondrocytes or stem cells, to regenerate cartilage tissue, offering potential for more effective healing. In contrast, non-cell-based therapies utilize synthetic materials, scaffolds, or biological agents to stimulate cartilage repair without live cells. Both methods aim to restore joint function and alleviate pain, catering to various patient needs and conditions.</p></p>
