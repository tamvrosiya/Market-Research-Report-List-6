<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Wheel Weight Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Clip-On Type</li><li>Adhesive Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The wheel weight market consists of two primary types: clip-on and adhesive weights. Clip-on weights are metal pieces that attach to the outer rim of the wheel for easy installation and removal, often used in steel wheels. In contrast, adhesive weights utilize a sticky backing, allowing them to be attached directly to the inside of the wheel, which enhances aesthetics and reduces wind noise. Both types are essential for maintaining tire balance and overall vehicle performance.</p></p>
