<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Anthrax Vaccines Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Live Vaccines</li><li>Cell free PA Vaccines</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The anthrax vaccines market primarily consists of two types: live vaccines and cell-free protective antigen (PA) vaccines. Live vaccines utilize attenuated strains of the anthrax-causing bacterium, providing strong immunity but may pose risks in immunocompromised individuals. In contrast, cell-free PA vaccines contain non-live components, specifically the protective antigen, offering a safer alternative with fewer side effects. Both types aim to boost immunity against anthrax, serving different needs in public health, military, and high-risk occupational settings.</p></p>
