<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Retro-Reflective Materials Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Microprismatic</li><li>Glass Beads</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The retro-reflective materials market primarily comprises two types: microprismatic and glass beads. Microprismatic materials utilize a series of tiny, prismatic structures to reflect light back to its source, offering higher visibility and durability. In contrast, glass beads consist of small spherical beads that scatter light, providing effective retro-reflection but with lower performance compared to microprismatics. Both types are essential in traffic signage, road markings, and safety garments, enhancing visibility and ensuring safety in various applications.</p></p>
