<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Antigen ELISA Kit Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Direct Test</li><li>Indirect Test</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Antigen ELISA Kit market comprises two primary types: direct tests and indirect tests. Direct tests detect the presence of antigens in a sample by binding them to specific antibodies immobilized on a solid surface, providing quick results. Indirect tests, on the other hand, identify antigens indirectly by first binding them with antibodies, followed by a secondary antibody that becomes detectable, enhancing sensitivity. Both methods are widely used for diagnosing infections and monitoring immune responses.</p></p>
