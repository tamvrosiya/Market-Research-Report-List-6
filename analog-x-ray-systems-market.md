<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Analog X-ray Systems Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Film Based</li><li>CR Film Cassette</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Analog X-ray systems encompass two primary types: film-based systems and CR (Computed Radiography) film cassette systems. Film-based systems require traditional X-ray film, which is exposed and processed to create images, relying on chemical development. In contrast, CR film cassette systems utilize special imaging plates to capture X-ray data, which is then digitized for enhanced image processing and analysis. Both methods serve to produce diagnostic images, though CR offers greater flexibility, efficiency, and the ability to integrate with digital workflows.</p></p>
