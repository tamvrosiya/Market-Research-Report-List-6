<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Intelligent Pump Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Centrifugal Pump</li><li>Positive Displacement Pump</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The intelligent pump market is primarily divided into two types: centrifugal pumps and positive displacement pumps. Centrifugal pumps utilize rotational energy to move fluids, making them ideal for applications requiring high flow rates and low viscosity fluids. In contrast, positive displacement pumps operate by trapping a fixed volume of fluid and forcing it through the discharge, suitable for high-viscosity fluids and precise flow control. Both pump types are increasingly integrated with smart technologies for enhanced efficiency, monitoring, and performance optimization.</p></p>
