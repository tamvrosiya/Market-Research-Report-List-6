<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Retread Tyres Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Pre Cure</li><li>Mold Cure</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The retread tyre market is primarily divided into two types: pre-cure and mold cure. Pre-cure retreading involves applying a pre-vulcanized tread band onto a prepared casing, followed by vulcanization in a separate process. This method offers versatility in tread designs and faster production times. In contrast, mold cure retreading involves placing the tyre casing into a heated mold, where both the new tread and casing are vulcanized simultaneously. This process results in a seamless finish and generally higher quality but is more time-consuming.</p></p>
