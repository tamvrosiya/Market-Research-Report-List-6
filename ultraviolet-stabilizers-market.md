<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Ultraviolet Stabilizers Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Hindered Amine Light Stabilizer (HALS)</li><li>UV Absorbers</li><li>Quenchers</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The ultraviolet stabilizers market includes three primary types: Hindered Amine Light Stabilizers (HALS), UV absorbers, and quenchers. HALS are used to protect polymers by scavenging free radicals, thereby enhancing longevity. UV absorbers function by absorbing harmful UV radiation and converting it into less damaging forms of energy, preventing degradation. Quenchers, on the other hand, dissipate the energy absorbed from UV light, minimizing the potential for damage. Together, these stabilizers play a crucial role in prolonging the life of materials exposed to sunlight.</p></p>
