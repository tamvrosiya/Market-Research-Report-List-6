<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Cranial Fixation Systems Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Absorbable Material</li><li>Non-Absorbable Material</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Cranial Fixation Systems encompass two main market types based on material composition: absorbable and non-absorbable materials. Absorbable materials are designed to gradually dissolve over time, eliminating the need for surgical removal and minimizing long-term complications. In contrast, non-absorbable materials provide permanent fixation, ensuring stability and durability in cranial surgeries. These systems are critical in neurosurgery and craniofacial reconstruction, aiding in the secure attachment of bone fragments or implants while accommodating patient-specific needs and enhancing clinical outcomes.</p></p>
