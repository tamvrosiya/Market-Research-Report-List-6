<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Ultrasound Probe Disinfection System Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>High-level Disinfection</li><li>Intermediate/Low-level Disinfection</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Ultrasound Probe Disinfection System market is categorized into two primary types: High-level Disinfection (HLD) and Intermediate/Low-level Disinfection. HLD is essential for sterilizing ultrasound probes that contact mucous membranes, ensuring complete elimination of all microorganisms, including spores. In contrast, Intermediate/Low-level Disinfection focuses on cleaning probes that do not penetrate sterile tissues, effectively reducing the presence of pathogens but not necessarily all spores. The choice between these methods hinges on the intended use and the level of risk associated with the procedures.</p></p>
