<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Powder-Actuated Nail Gun Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Direct Drive Nail Gun</li><li>Indirect Drive Nail Gun</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The powder-actuated nail gun market features two primary types: direct drive and indirect drive nail guns. Direct drive nail guns utilize a piston mechanism powered by explosive charges, allowing for rapid nail placement directly into hard materials. In contrast, indirect drive nail guns operate with a simpler mechanism where the charge drives a rod that in turn pushes the nail into the substrate. Both types are widely used in construction and manufacturing for their efficiency and effectiveness in fastening applications.</p></p>
